## Introduction

### Problem statement

### Prior work

## Objectives
1. Use machine learning models to predict missing ICD-10.
2. Use machine learning models to verify ICD-10 labelled by human.

## Aims
1. The performance of machine learning model shows precision, recall, and F-measure are greater than 80%.
2. Present one year cost-benefit analysis compared between before and after using machine learning models to fill ICD-10.

## Time line
### March 2019
  * Write and submit a research proposal and ethic.
  * Setup a new server.
  * Duplicate clinical data to the server.
  * Map and label column name and description.
  * Join the table data and create a single dataset.
### April 2019
  * Apply NLP and standard medical terminologies to preprocess input features.
  * Design and evaluate machine learning model.
### May 2019
  * Close the project either, the model performance is greater than 80% or it is the last week of May.
### June - August 2019
  * Write and submit a paper.
  
## Materials and methods
### Target group
Clinical records of outer-patient visits from 2006 - 2017 (2006 - 2016 for a training set, and 2017 for a test set) are retrospectively retrieved from the Maharaj Nakhon Chiang Mai electronic health records. Approximately one million records are expected to retrieve per year. Only encoded data (number, string) are included in the experiment (excluded images and scanned document).

### Data preprocessing
All identification data such as name, surname, address, national identification, hospital number will be removed according to patient privacy. Data of interest include:
  * Demographic data such as date of birth, gender
  * History taking and physical examination (including discharge summary)
  * Laboratory and investigation reports
  * ICD-10 (coded by a technical coder)
  
## Data analysis
Data from 2006 - 2016 are used to train machine learning models and data from 2017 are used to evaluate the models. We use overall accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and area under ROC curve to evaluate and compare predictive performance between models.

## How to use
1. Clone the project and change to dev branch
```
git clone https://github.com/u4507075/icd_10.git
cd icd_10
git checkout dev
```
2. Check out and update dev branch
```
git fetch
git checkout dev
git pull
```
